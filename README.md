# Big-Friday-Sales-Prediction

## Modeling
Splitted dataset into train and test subset of ratio 70:30
Used pipeline for data preprocessing and model training.

## Evaluation Metric
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is a standard way to measure the error of a model in predicting quantitative data. Itâ€™s the square root of the average of squared differences between prediction and actual observation.

## Inference
Implanted multiple supervised models such as Linear Regressor,Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and XGBOOST Regressor. Out of these supervised models, based on the RMSE scores XGBRegressor/XGBOOST Regressor was the best performer with a score of 2890.
